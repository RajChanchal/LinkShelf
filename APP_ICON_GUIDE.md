# App Icon Guide for App Store

## Required Icon Sizes

### For App Store Connect (Required):
- **1024 x 1024px** - This is the main icon you upload to App Store Connect
  - Format: PNG (no alpha channel/transparency)
  - Must be exactly 1024x1024 pixels
  - Square icon
  - No rounded corners (Apple adds them automatically)

### For the App Bundle (Already configured):
Your app icon asset catalog is set up for these sizes:
- 16x16, 32x32, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 (1x and 2x versions)

## Creating Your App Icon

### Option 1: Design in Design Tool (Recommended)
1. Create a 1024x1024px design in:
   - **Sketch**
   - **Figma** (free)
   - **Photoshop**
   - **Affinity Designer**

2. Design elements:
   - Use the link/chain icon concept (matches your menu bar icon)
   - Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
   - Use your brand colors
   - Ensure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds

3. Export as PNG (no transparency)

### Option 2: Generate from Existing Icon
If you have a high-quality version of your menu bar icon, you can:
1. Start with a 1024x1024px canvas
2. Place your icon in the center
3. Add background color/gradient
4. Export as PNG

### Option 3: Use SF Symbols as Base
Since your app uses the "link" SF Symbol, you could:
1. Create a 1024x1024px design
2. Use a large link icon in the center
3. Add a background that matches your app's aesthetic
4. Export

## Quick Icon Generator Script

I've created a script that can help generate the 1024x1024 icon from a source image.

## App Store Connect Upload

Once you have your 1024x1024 icon:
1. Go to App Store Connect
2. Navigate to your app
3. Go to **App Information** → **App Icon**
4. Upload your 1024x1024 PNG file

## Tips

- **No text**: Icons should work without text labels
- **Simple design**: Should be recognizable at small sizes
- **Consistent**: Should match your menu bar icon style
- **High quality**: Use vector graphics when possible, export at high resolution
- **Test**: View the icon at different sizes to ensure it looks good
